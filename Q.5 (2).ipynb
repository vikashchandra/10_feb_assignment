    "-resistant manner. The primary advantage of using the with \n",
    "statement with open() is that it ensures that the file is\n",
    "properly opened and closed, even if an error occurs during the \n",
    "execution of your code. This is commonly referred to as \n",
    "\"context management\" or \"context handling.\"\n",

    "Here's how the with statement works with open() and its \n",
    "advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Resource Management: When you open a file using the\n",
    "with statement, Python takes care of properly opening and closing the file. This means that when you enter the with block, the file is automatically opened, and when you exit the block, the file is automatically closed. You don't have to explicitly call file.close() to close the file. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that the file is closed, even if an exception occurs.\n",

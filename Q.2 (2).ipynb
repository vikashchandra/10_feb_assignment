    " Q.2. Why close() function is used?\n",
    " Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "solution:\n",
    "The close() function in Python is used to close a file that has\n",
    "been previously opened using the open() function. \n",
    "It is important to close a file after you have finished working \n",
    "with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When you open a file, the operating system \n",
    "allocates certain resources (such as file handles or memory \n",
    "buffers) to maintain the connection between your program and the\n",
    "file. Failing to close a file properly can lead to resource leaks,\n",
    "which can eventually lead to your program running out of available\n",
    "resources. Closing the file releases these resources back to the \n",
    "operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: When you write data to a file, it is often\n",
    "buffered in memory before it is actually written to the file on\n",
    "disk. If you do not close the file, there's a risk that some data\n",
    "may not be written to the file, leading to incomplete or \n",
    "corrupted files. Closing the file ensures that all buffered data\n",
    "is flushed to the file before it is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locking: In some operating systems, a file may be locked for \n",
    "exclusive access while it is open. If you don't close the file\n",
    "properly, it may remain locked, preventing other processes or\n",
    "programs from accessing it until your program terminates. Closing \n",
    "the file releases the lock, allowing other processes to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Portability: Some platforms and Python implementations may have\n",
    "limits on the number of files that can be open simultaneously. \n",
    "Failing to close files can lead to reaching these limits, causing\n",
    "your program to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a  example of how to open and close a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "# Open a file for reading\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Do some operations with the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file when done\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# File is automatically closed when the block is exited\n",
    "Using the with statement is considered best practice because it \n",
    "ensures that the file is always properly closed, reducing the risk of resource leaks and data corruption."
